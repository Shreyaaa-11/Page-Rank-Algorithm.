#  ðŸ“Š PageRank Algorithm Visualization using NetworkX & Matplotlib
This project implements and visualizes the PageRank algorithm on a directed graph using Python's networkx and matplotlib libraries. It helps understand how importance (or "rank") is distributed across nodes in a directed network like the web or citation systems.

## ðŸ§  What is PageRank?
PageRank is an algorithm originally used by Google Search to rank web pages. It measures the relative importance of each node in a graph based on the structure of incoming links. Nodes with more high-quality inbound links receive a higher score.

### ðŸ’¡ What I gained:
- Understanding **graph theory**
- Learning how **PageRank** distributes importance
- Visual learners who benefit from seeing how algorithms work
- Applying **Python data visualization** tools in network analysis
